    <h1>Some things about Kelsee</h1>

    <article>
        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Kelsee. Im 27 years old and I am from Memphis. I'm an innovative professional with a wide range of skills and experience gained from a variety of roles. I'm currently learning software development trough CodeCrew's Code School with the intent to become a web developer. Coming from a mixed background of customer service and supply chain distribution my varied experiences allow me to quickly adapt to different environments and challenges while also being accommodating and welcoming to people from all backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>My personal interests include, visual arts, music, and most recently fashion. I've created and sold a number of mix media acrylic paintings. I've written and recorded original songs and features. I've recently begun to explore self expression through fashion and have since turned my living room into a <q>walk-through</q> closet. If that's not innovative I don't know what is.</p>

        <p>My short term goals include completing this course and securing employement related to my current feild of study, and completing at least one of my passion projects within the next year. I am so easily inspired by the world around me--though not always as easily motivated. I am passionate about learning new things about myself and the world we live in. My creativity and curiosity can be a strong asset to any company or organization. </p>

    <h2>Number guessing game</h2>

    <p>Muahahaha!!! I have hatched a diabolical plan! I'm going to stop the world like Beyonce said. I got so much heat I'm influencing climate change by uploading my murzik to soundcloud. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 30. Guess how many tracks will be on this certified classic. I'll let you know if you on to something. Might be a surprise for you if you get it right.</p>
